**What is an Internal Block Diagram (IBD) in SysML?**

An Internal Block Diagram (IBD) is a SysML structural diagram that shows the **internal structure** of a *specific block*. It depicts the **parts** (instances of other blocks) contained within that block, how those parts are **connected** to each other, and how they connect to the **ports** of the enclosing block.

Think of it like this:
*   If a Block Definition Diagram (BDD) is the blueprint for a *type* of component (e.g., "Car"),
*   Then an IBD is a detailed diagram showing the *insides* of one specific instance or usage of that "Car" (e.g., showing its engine, wheels, and transmission connected together).

The IBD focuses on the *usage* and *interaction* of components *within* a defined boundary. It essentially "zooms in" on a block defined in a BDD to elaborate on its internal composition and connections.

**Most Important Features of an IBD:**

1.  **Frame (Context Block):**
    *   **What it is:** The IBD is always drawn within a frame that represents the block whose internal structure is being described.
    *   **Representation:** A rectangle labeled with the name of the block and its type (e.g., `mySystem : SystemBlock` or simply `SystemBlock` if it's defining the general internal structure for all instances of that type).
    *   **Significance:** Clearly defines the boundary and context for the internal elements.

2.  **Parts (Part Properties):**
    *   **What they are:** These represent the *instances* or *roles* played by blocks *inside* the framing block. They are usages of block types that were defined on a BDD.
    *   **Representation:** Rectangles drawn *inside* the frame. Each part is labeled with its role name and its type (e.g., `engine : Engine`, `frontLeftWheel : Wheel`). Multiplicity can also be shown (e.g., `wheels : Wheel [4]`).
    *   **Significance:** Shows the decomposition of the block into its constituent components.

3.  **Ports (Usages):**
    *   **What they are:** These are specific interaction points on the boundaries of the *parts* or on the *frame* of the IBD. These are instances or usages of the port definitions made on a BDD.
    *   **Representation:** Small squares on the edge of the parts or the frame. They are typically named.
    *   **Significance:** Define how components (parts) and the enclosing block itself can interact with their environment or with each other.

4.  **Connectors:**
    *   **What they are:** Lines that show how parts are linked together through their ports, or how parts are linked to the ports of the enclosing block. They represent pathways for interaction or flow.
    *   **Representation:** Solid lines connecting ports.
    *   **Types of Connectors:**
        *   **Assembly Connector:** Connects ports of two *internal parts*. This signifies that these parts interact directly within the enclosing block.
        *   **Delegation Connector:** Connects a port of an *internal part* to a port on the *frame* of the enclosing block. This means that an interaction occurring at the boundary of the enclosing block is delegated to/from an internal part.
    *   **Significance:** Crucial for understanding how interactions and flows are routed within the block and to/from its exterior.

5.  **Item Flows:**
    *   **What they are:** Indicate the type of items (data, material, energy, signals) that flow across a connector between ports.
    *   **Representation:** An arrow stereotyped `<<itemFlow>>` (often implicit and just shown as an arrow with a label) placed on or near a connector. The label indicates the type of item flowing (e.g., `Power`, `ControlSignal`, `SensorData`).
    *   **Direction:** The arrowhead indicates the direction of the flow.
    *   **Significance:** Makes the nature of the interaction explicit, showing what is being exchanged between connected parts.

6.  **Interfaces (Usage Context):**
    *   While interfaces are *defined* on BDDs (often as `<<interfaceBlock>>`), IBDs show how these interfaces are *used*. Ports are often typed by interfaces. A connector between two ports implies that they adhere to compatible interfaces (e.g., one port provides an interface, the other requires it).
    *   **Significance:** Ensures that connected components can "understand" each other.

**In Summary:**

The IBD is essential for:
*   **Visualizing Decomposition:** Showing how a complex block is made up of simpler parts.
*   **Understanding Interactions:** Detailing how these internal parts are wired together and how they communicate.
*   **Defining Internal Behavior Context:** Providing the structural context for how the parts will collaborate to achieve the overall function of the enclosing block.
*   **Interface Management:** Showing how the block interacts with its external environment through its own ports, and how those external interactions are handled by internal parts (via delegation).
*   **Analyzing Flow:** Tracing the flow of information, energy, or material through the system.

Where a BDD defines the *types* and their potential features, the IBD shows a *specific configuration* or *usage scenario* of those types, demonstrating how they are instantiated, assembled, and connected to work together within a larger component.
